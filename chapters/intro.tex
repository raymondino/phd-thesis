\section{Thesis Organization}

This document begins by presenting the necessary background (include domain specific terminology and related works) for understanding my contributions (Chapter~\ref{chapt:bg}).
I then present a working proof-of-concept experiment (Chapter~\ref{chapt:pub1}).
The challenges faced in this proof-of-concept experiment lead to my research on three distinct problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Thing A (Chapter~\ref{chapt:a});
  \item Thing B (Chapter~\ref{chapt:b});
  \item Thing C (Chapter~\ref{chapt:c});
\end{itemize}
Finally, I present my research contributions and discuss the conclusions drawn from these experiments (Chapter~\ref{chapt:conc}).
